    <h4><P>An orphanage is a residential institution, total institution or group home, devoted to the care of orphans and children who, for various reasons, cannot be cared for by their biological families. The parents may be deceased, absent, or abusive. There may be substance abuse or mental illness in the biological home, or the parent may simply be unwilling to care for the child. The legal responsibility for the support of abandoned children differs from country to country, and within countries. Government-run orphanages have been phased out in most developed countries during the latter half of the 20th century but continue to operate in many other regions internationally.<ins style="color: blue;"> It is now generally accepted that orphanages are detrimental to the emotional wellbeing of children, and government support goes instead towards supporting the family unit</ins>.

        A few large international charities continue to fund orphanages.</P></h4>

        <h2><p><b><ins>Indian laws to protect orphans:</ins></b>
        </p></h2>
    <h2><P>1.)The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:
    </P></h2>
    <h4><P>This Act is concerned with children in conflict with law and children in need of care and protection.<ins style="color: blue;"> It prescribes institutional care for children through shelter homes, children’s homes etc</ins>. and non-institutional care through foster care, adoption, sponsorships and after-care organizations. In 2021, the Parliament of India amended the Act, bringing changes to the provisions concerning adoption. Prior to the amendment, civil courts were entrusted with the power to issue adoption orders. With the amendment, only District Magistrates can issue such orders. </P></h4> 
    <h2><P>2.)The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956:</P></h2>
    <h4><P><ins style="color: blue;">Act criminalizes prostitution and trafficking, particularly the keeping of certain premises as brothels and living on the income earned through prostitution</ins>, though it doesn’t criminalize prostitution done independently and voluntarily. This Act is relevant as it protects orphans from trafficking and prostitution. </P></h4>
    <h2><P>3.)The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009:</P></h2> 
    <h4><P>According to Article 21-A of the Indian Constitution, <ins style="color: blue;"> is a fundamental right of every child from the age of six to fourteen, to receive free education.</ins> This Act guarantees the protection of that right and allocates responsibilities to the governments at different levels. This Act ensures that orphans are not deprived of their fundamental right to free and compulsory education. As it is a requisite for orphanages to provide education, the Board of Control can inspect whether these institutions keep up with it and is empowered to revoke their certificate if they don’t. </P></h4>
    <h2><P>4.)The POCSO Act, 2012:</P></h2>
    <h4><p><ins style="color: blue;">" Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 was enacted to protect children from all forms of sexual abuse, regardless of their gender.</ins> The Act prescribes strict punishments for those who subject children to any kind of sexual harassment. This Act protects orphans who are extremely vulnerable to sexual exploitation. </p></h4>
    <h2><p><b><ins>Legal rights of orphans:</ins></b></p></h2>
    <h2><p style="color: brown;">*Right to life:</p></h2>
    <h4><P>Article 21 of the Indian constitution guarantees the protection of the life and liberty of every person. This would protect orphans as they are extremely vulnerable.<ins style="color: blue;"> Article 21 upholds their right to live and exercise liberty just like everyone else.</ins> </P></h4>
    <h2><p style="color: brown;">*Right to health:</p></h2>  
    <h4><p>The interpretation of Article 21 is inclusive of the right to health.<ins style="color: blue;">Every orphan child has the right to good physical and mental health</ins></p></h4>
    <h2><p style="color: brown;">*Right to citizenship:</p></h2>
    <h4><p>Part II of the Indian Constitution elaborates on the right to citizenship.<ins style="color: blue;">Every orphan has the right to have a name that is legally recorded and citizenship to any country.</ins> This ensures that any state would protect their welfare. </p></h4>
    <h2><p style="color: brown;">*Right to education:</p></h2>
    <h4><p><ins style="color: blue;">21-A promises all children between the age of six to fourteen that they shall receive free education.</ins> This puts the responsibility on the state to ensure that orphans receive basic education just like other children.</p></h4>
